# Translator-App
 To accomplish this, we'll use the translate module in Python, which utilizes machine translation services such as Google Translate. Here's an outline of the steps we'll follow:

Install the translate module by running pip install translate in your terminal or command prompt.

Import the necessary modules:
from translate import Translator

Create a function to handle the translation process:

Prompt the user for input:

Call the translate_text function and display the translation:

Run the program and test it by entering the source language, target language, and the text you want to translate.

This simple translator app allows you to enter the source language, target language, and the text you want to translate. It then utilizes the translate module to perform the translation using an AI-powered machine translation service.
